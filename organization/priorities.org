* Software objectives
** Decide on computers
*** space             - 
*** suborbital        - Raspberry Pi 0W
*** 1-U test platform - Raspberry Pi 0W
** Order minimal set of sensors
*** need to recheck that sensors work together
*** build plan for each sensor's integration
** Develop test modules for each sensor
** GNU Make builds
*** --no-graphics
**** removes all graphics and user input from the program
**** these aren't needed and present a potential source of failure during the mission
**** we do, however, want them for testing
*** --no-<sensor>
**** removes sensor code
**** old sensors need not be in the release candidates
**** keeps the 1-U and suborbital programs from needlessly re-developing
*** --no-serial
**** excises all serial-bound sensors
**** useful for developing on other protocols
*** --no-i2c
**** excises all i2c-bound sensors
**** useful for developing on other protocols
** OS changes
*** slim down OS to minimal set of processes
*** potentially apply a real-time patch to the Linux Kernel
*** close all networking
** Order rest of sensors
** Order rad-hard SD card
** Build sensor suite
** Test final program
