Pressure calibration code

Taking data from 3 consecutive tests (all in one file) and matching results with recorded pressure values.
Process is inherently a little complex because the PI which was recording raw sensor values had to be entirely within the pressure vessel being used

Any questions about the code and calibration process should be directed at Justin
Questions about the pressure sensors and electronics setup should be directed at Sean
